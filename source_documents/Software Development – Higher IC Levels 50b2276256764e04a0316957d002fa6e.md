# Software Development â€“ Higher IC Levels

Much like with management careers, as ICs advance upward roles become exponentially more rare. Not every team needs an L5+ IC, and most do not need more than one. 

As such, **being promoted to a higher level of IC role requires a combination of a meeting the target skills level, a mandate and role to fill, and a desire to take on more technical responsibility.** 

If you are curious about advanced IC career paths, and both what those roles might look like in addition to understanding whether you would like such a role, we recommend reading the [Staff Engineer book and website](https://staffeng.com/book). The Pragmatic Programmer also has a good [overview of technical leadership paths](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/engineering-leadership-skillset-overlaps), including IC careers above senior level.
