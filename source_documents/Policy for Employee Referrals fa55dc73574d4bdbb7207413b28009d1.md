# Policy for Employee Referrals

# Employee referral bonus policy

We are pleased to be able to provide employees the opportunity to receive a referral bonus to recruit qualified candidates from within their networks. We place great importance on referrals because we have confidence that our employees are committed to the success of our team.

This policy has been developed to provide guidance for the Referral Bonus Policy.

# Bonus payment

If a referred candidate is hired **on a permanent full time basis**, the employee who referred them will receive a taxable bonus of $4000 CAD 90 days after the referred candidate's start date, and then another taxable bonus of $4000 CAD after the referred candidate has been employed with AlleyCorp Nord for one full year. To receive the referral bonus, the referring employee must be actively employed with the Company and not have given notice of resignation.

Anyone that is referred that we hire o**n a temporary part-time, temporary full-time or contract (**i.e.: student, stagiaire, interneship) basis, **is not eligible** for the referral bonus. However, If that employee is **converted to a permanent full time employee,** that would then start the clock on their first day of permanent employment and the employee that referred them would then be eligible for the referral bonus.

# How to refer a candidate

Send an email to referral@alleycorpnord.com

Please ensure that you have the explicit consent of the candidate before releasing their personal information to us.

All submissions will be reviewed, however, only candidates who meet the essential qualifications for the position will be considered. AlleyCorp Nord is not obligated to contact or consider every employee referral that is submitted.

- All candidates will be evaluated for employment consistent with AlleyCorp Nord’s policies and procedures, including any conflict of interest or employment or employment equity policies.
