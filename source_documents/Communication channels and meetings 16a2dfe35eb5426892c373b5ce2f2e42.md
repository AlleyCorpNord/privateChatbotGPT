# Communication channels and meetings

# Slack

Slack is used for daily communication.

Slack should be treated as ephemeral (even if it is not). Back-to-back announcements should be sent via email and technical decisions should be documented in Notion or the appropriate project documentation tool.

Everyone is encouraged to use Do Not Disturb as well as status to best manage their work. 

## #announcements

This channel is for workspace-wide communication and announcements. All members are in this channel.

**The #announcements channel is locked, and only managers and HR can post to it.**

Please enable notifications for #announcements to receive an alert for important company updates.

## #general

Anyone can post in general, but remember to keep it work-related.

Good topics for #general:

- "Does anyone know where I can find a policy for ___?"
- "I created a new channel for ___, join if you want!"

## #appreciation-corner

Warm & fuzzy things, and also a feed from 15five.

## Other channels

## #education

This channel has posts about educational books, conferences, etc.

## #random

A place for work-related flimflam, faffing, hodge-podge or jibber-jabber youâ€™d prefer to keep out of more work focused related channels. Anyone can post in this channel. 

Donut will ask watercooler topic questions here like: 

- Whatâ€™s a song you loved as a teenager?
- Whatâ€™s your favorite childhood movie you still love to watch as an adult?

## #social

# Meetings & Events

**A note on calendars:**

We use team@alleycorpnord.com for full-team recurring event invites. [Unfortunately,](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/172013?hl=en) due to Google Calendar restrictions, events sent to a group wonâ€™t show up on an individual team memberâ€™s calendar unless they accept the invitation. So, please search your email for invitations to events with the names below, accept, and from that point on you can decline individual instances as needed.

## All Hands

Tuesday tea time replaces lunch and learns in the event of a work-from-home pandemic.

**Each week**, one or more team members present something - from a lightning talk (<10 min) to a full presentation to a project demo.

Members of the "extended" community are invited, e.g. engineers and designers from some of the companies we work with.

Some guidelines:

- Focus on education, but CHILL. You don't need to spend much time preparing.
- Drop down list of topics with some sort of light registration/agenda
- Supporting documents

Tuesday tea time supersedes lunch & learns in pandemic work-from-home times. 

## Friday Happy Hour

**NOTE:** This is being retooled. TBD.
We play games or chat. Optional!
