**Mental Health Support**

This service is available 24/7 on demand so you can get the help you need at any time and without an appointment. Nurse practitioners and doctors are available to give you primary  mental support via text and video.

You can also book an appointment with one of their mental health specialists; these video therapy sessions will be done directly on the app but require an appointment, which incurs additional costs. You can book an appointment by speaking to one of Telus’ care managers, who will help you identify the specialist who is the best match for your needs. Their care managers will always tell you of the costs when you book your appointment.

**The specialists available are:** 
Registered social workers, psychologists, psychotherapists, clinical counselors, dietitians and physiotherapists. Check the app or initiate a consultation to confirm availability in your province.
