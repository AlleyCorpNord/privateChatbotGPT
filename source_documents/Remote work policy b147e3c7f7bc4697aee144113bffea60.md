# Remote work policy

This policy has been developed to provide formal guidance and direction on remote work that will promote a better work-life balance for employees, while ensuring an increased level of employee health and safety and greater business continuity.

**NOTE:** We hire in Canada (Eastern Standard Time Zone) and are not able to issue work Visa’s for other countries.

**NOTE:** Any changes (whether that is permanent or temporary) for remote working outside of the province of your employment contract must be pre-approved.

# Benefits of Working Remotely

If necessary, the Company is prepared to reimburse employees for expenses reasonably incurred to enable employees to work from home. The Company will provide employees with a laptop computer to perform their duties. If additional equipment is required, the employee may purchase items for reimbursement up to **an annual maximum of $2,000 CDN** in the employee's **first year of employment and $500 each year thereafter**, with any individual purchase over $500 CDN to be approved by your manager/supervisor prior to purchase. .

Employees must submit an expense report via [Expensify](https://join.my.expensify.com/?team=E6F3F569BA98A788&thanks=floh%40alleycorpnord.com) with all corresponding receipts no later than 1 month after the expense is incurred. Annual maximums are for office equipment required only on an as-needed basis and unused amounts cannot be carried over to the next calendar year.

All expenses will be processed through PEO payroll upon approval by your manager/supervisor.

Generally, remote work expenses are anything that allows employees to work comfortably at home that they would reasonably expect to have in an office - for example, a monitor or other peripherals, ergonomic chairs, wireless internet equipment. If in doubt about what constitutes a reimbursable remote work expense, please ask your manager/supervisor before purchasing.

With the exception of the laptop, any additional equipment purchased will be the property of the employee. If you leave the company during your probationary period, you agree that any amounts reimbursed for equipment will revert to the company and may be deducted from your final salary. The employee must arrange for the return of the laptop to the Company on the last day of employment.

Employees working from home must be accessible and able to give their full attention to their duties during work hours. Employees are expected to perform their duties and tasks at home as they would at their place of employment. The Company offers flexibility in work schedules, but employees must ensure that they are diligent in attending all scheduled meetings.

# Remote Employee Health and Safety

The Company is committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace for all employees. To ensure the safety of employees while working from home, Company employees are responsible for identifying a workspace free of distractions and other hazards and maintaining the safety standards they would observe while working on site. If safety hazards are observed in the home workspace, please notify your manager/supervisor to discuss appropriate corrective action.

Any safety incident or near miss should be reported as if it occurred while working on site. If you are injured while performing work, the following steps should be followed:

- Contact outside emergency response agencies, if necessary;
- Report the accident to your manager;
- Report the accident to PEO Canada's WCB contact at 1-877-271-7720. This call will initiate appropriate claims processing and notifications to the appropriate workers' compensation board.
- If an injury does not require medical attention, your manager should still contact the PEO Canada WCB contact and indicate that the injury is "report only" in case medical treatment is needed later and to ensure that any existing safety hazards are corrected.

If you have any questions or concerns, contact your manager and/or PEO Canada for more information.

# Privacy and Company Property

Employees working from home may use company cell phones and other equipment in addition to the company laptop. This equipment remains the property of the company and its use must be in accordance with company policies, including, but not limited to, the company's policies on the use of Internet and e-mail technology and anti-harassment and anti-bullying.
Similarly, all company privacy, confidentiality and code of conduct policies remain in effect while working from home. Employees must comply with all other computer security measures implemented by the Company and inform their manager if their remote working conditions prevent them from doing so.
Employees must take appropriate steps to protect confidential material not housed in the electronic system. Information should be printed only when necessary, confidential documents should be placed in a secure location (e.g., a locked cabinet) when not in use, and disposed of properly when no longer needed.

# On-Site Work

The Company reserves the right to designate a central office location in the future and to modify this policy with written notice.  An employee’s ability to work under a Remote Work Policy rests in the sole discretion of the Company.
