    - Understanding the client’s business and recommending specific services to suit their needs;

### Practice Lead

The practice lead is a subject matter expert for their domain within the company, as well as an ambassador for the company. While a practice lead is not *necessarily* a manager with direct authority over a particular work stream, they act as a facilitator of discussion, as well as formal mentor, and advisor to team members. 

Their role includes:

- Curating best practices and toolkits for their area of expertise, including contributions to the ACN playbook and technology radar.
- Engaging employees and third parties in maintaining best practices and toolkits; liaising with managers and other individuals to prioritize strategic contributions to company tools (e.g. open source utilities, component kits, etc.).
