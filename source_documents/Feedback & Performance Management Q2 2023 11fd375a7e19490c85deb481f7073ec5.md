# Feedback & Performance Management Q2 2023

We provide ongoing feedback and performance management through 15five.

# Check-ins

15five provides prompts for feedback weekly. Every Friday 15five will email you a reminder to answer a quick (~15 min) form, which will be reviewed by your manager (as per the name, in 5 minutes). This is mostly used as a status report and for follow-up, on any issues you may be having with prioritization of tasks, etc. 

15five is a tool that facilitates ongoing feedback and performance management within organizations. One of its features is the "high five" tool, which allows you to praise your team members. 

This feature is great because it helps build a positive and supportive team culture. When team members receive recognition and praise from their peers, they feel valued and appreciated for their hard work. This can boost morale, increase motivation, and improve productivity.

The "high five" feature is also integrated with Slack, which means that when you use it to recognize a team member's efforts, the praise is automatically posted to a Slack channel. This can help spread positivity and encourage others to do the same.

# Internal promotions

The 90-day assessment is crucial in determining whether you have consistently met or exceeded expectations, achieved your goals, and demonstrated the necessary skills and competencies for your current role level.

A promotion often involves assuming a leadership role. This 90-day evaluation focuses on identifying leadership qualities, such as effective communication, decision-making skills, problem-solving abilities, and the capacity to inspire and motivate others.

# Career Hub

Career Hub is a feature offered through 15Five that helps employees manage their career development. It allows employees to set goals, track their progress towards those goals, and receive feedback from their manager and peers. With Career Hub, employees can take ownership of their career development and identify areas where they need to improve in order to achieve their career goals. Overall, Career Hub is a valuable tool for employees who are looking to grow and develop in their roles.

As we move forward in our ongoing efforts to facilitate effective feedback and performance management, we are excited to announce a new function and stage that we will be implementing throughout the course of this year.

# Performance management

[Q2 2023 YE Performance Review Cycle](Q2%202023%20YE%20Performance%20Review%20Cycle%20bff3e10ead84446db7ff3346b9275afd.md)

Through 15Five, we can manage OKRs (Objectives and Key Results), performance reviews, and feedback loops more efficiently and effectively. This allows us to stay on top of employee progress and provide timely feedback to help them grow and develop in their roles.

Overall, we believe that utilizing 15Five has been instrumental in driving employee growth and development, and we will continue to use it to facilitate ongoing feedback and performance management within our organization.
