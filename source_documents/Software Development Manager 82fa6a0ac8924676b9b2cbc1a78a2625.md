# Software Development Manager

This document represents the job responsibilities for a “standard” Software Development Manager job, wherein a manager has a team or teams of individuals — primarily but not exclusively developers — reporting to them in the context of a specific ACN client company. 

Other management jobs may have different scopes and therefore somewhat different responsibilities, but since SDM is the most common management job at ACN, this page is meant to serve as a reference for the full scope of management responsibilities.

This document is long, in the interest of capturing the details of an SDM’s responsibilities as fully as possible. We do not expect that all bullet points outlined in the Responsibilities section below will be relevant to a single SDM on a daily basis.

This document is a ******************************living document******************************, updated to reflect current realities.

# Responsibilities

In brief, the Software Development Manager (SDM) is accountable for the output their team(s), and has a variety of areas of ownership, where they are expected to either directly contribute to this output, or to delegate execution to the most appropriate team member(s), e.g. staff engineers, PMs, senior developers acting as team leads ([The Technical Lead](The%20Technical%20Lead%201a0d7a3555bc41b8a143434327214bb4.md)).

In most teams at ACN, the SDM is expected to **contribute hands-on to development** (or data science, design, infrastructure — whatever their area of expertise), since most teams are quite small. Once a team grows past a certain size, contributing directly on a regular basis may no longer be feasible. Managers are expected to prioritize their management responsibilities over direct delivery, and as such tend to contribute outside the critical path when possible.

The SDM is accountable for their **team’s software output, and more specifically, for the software development lifecycle**, which includes:

- Planning and prioritizing deliveries and their related quality and stability;
- Highlighting time or resource constraints impacting deliveries to team members and stakeholders;
- Interrogating and conveying the business context and relative importance of (non-functional, primarily) requirements, constraints, and metrics on deliveries and their timelines;
- Communicating commitments and risks clearly to the team and stakeholders;
- Proactively identifying blockers for the team and helping them to address or mitigate them;
- Continuously updating the team on evolving priorities as needed;
- Ensuring the timely and thorough review of code and other deliverables (e.g. mockups, RFCs, spikes, documentation);
- Working closely with team members and stakeholders to ensure functional requirements for software delivery are clearly understood, challenged, and documented;
- Tracking time related to third-party funding or tax credits (e.g. SR&ED or government grants).

It is worth noting that ACN teams vary in structure — some SDMs may work closely with a product manager, some may have a designer on their teams, whereas some may have neither. This first area of responsibility is the one that changes the most in its day-to-day execution depending on the rest of the team. (See also: ‣ for guidance on making sense of gray areas between PMs and SDMs.)

Additionally, the SDM is accountable for **architecture and technology strategy**, including but not limited to:

- Ensuring due diligence of stack and tooling choices, including their associated budgets and implementation timelines;
- Communicating the value of technological choices and projects to stakeholders;
- Continuously challenging team members on their architectural decisions (viability, stability, relevance to the business, etc);
- Helping team members articulate and explain technical decisions to stakeholders;
- Identifying tooling and process needs for improving the team's ability to deliver;
- Working with their manager and the ACN finance team to appropriately document the technology developed by their team that is eligible for tax credits such as SR&ED.

The SDM is responsible for **hiring** for their team, and is expected to contribute to hiring at ACN overall, specifically by:

- Providing timely information and budgets to stakeholders (e.g. clients, ACN executives) and the talent team regarding their team’s hiring needs;
- Collaborating with executives at their client company, as well as ACN leadership on decisions related to full-time and part-time staffing (e.g. the deployment of third party contractors);
- Reviewing job descriptions, postings, and other hiring-related work product created by the talent team;
- Leading and participating in interviews, and subsequently providing feedback on candidates and, when relevant, the interview process and format;

The SDM is responsible for **teambuilding & team health**, which includes:

- Onboarding new team members and ensuring they are able to contribute to the team quickly (which may include 30/60/90 onboarding plans, an onboarding buddy, or other tools and techniques);
- Organizing regular exercises for reflection (e.g. retrospectives), learning, and bonding;
- Tracking and reporting on team productivity

The SDM is responsible for **performance management** on their team and contributes to performance management at ACN overall, which includes:

- Providing timely feedback on job performance to their direct reports, on an ongoing basis as well as during formal performance management exercises;
- Creating objectives for team members, in consultation with relevant parties, and tracking their progress regularly;
- Having regular 1:1s and asynchronous check-ins with their team (in line with company tooling and processes);
- Working with the HR team as needed to resolve conflict, implement formal warnings and improvement plans, and ultimately make team transfer or firing decisions;
- Managing time off requests as per company policy and in consultation with relevant parties.

Finally, the SDM is an **ambassador and sponsor of their team within ACN, and a bridge between ACN leadership and their teams**. This means they are expected to share the team’s wins and contributions with the broader ACN community, and encourage their team members to participate in company-wide initiatives where relevant. In the event of a team dissolution (e.g. due to client company bankruptcy), the SDM will work closely with executives and the talent team to ensure the best outcomes for team members.

## A week in the life

An SDM’s week may look very different depending on the stage of their team and its composition. However, most managers will have a mix of the following:

- 1:1s — weekly or biweekly with their direct reports, direct manager, and closest collaborators
- Planning meetings — these vary wildly, and may be full grooming sessions with the team, or smaller group brainstorms and reviews
- Stakeholder and vendor meetings
- Blocks of IC time
    - Contributing to code — typically outside the critical path
    - Writing documentation and compiling reports
    - Reviewing work (prototypes, RFCs, PRs, 15five check-ins, objectives progress)

## Success factors

A common question in management roles is “how do I know if I’m doing a good job?”. 

As a rule of thumb, a manager is performing well if they are:

- Maximizing productivity on their team — ie. ensuring everyone is working *****smart***** (not necessarily hard) and delivering results
- Managing up effectively — ie. making the right data and outcomes visible before anyone asks pointed questions
- Keeping their team motivated and happy — ie. ensuring everyone has work that is the right mix of challenging and achievable
