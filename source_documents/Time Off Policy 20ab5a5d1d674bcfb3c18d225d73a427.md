# Time Off Policy

# Time off policy

We believe that in order to do our best, most creative work and be excellent team members, we all need to take time off for rest, relaxation, recovery and rejuvenation. In addition, we want you to take the time you need to recover from illness (whether physical or mental) without loss of income.

The Company provides a time off policy for all employees in accordance with Provincial Employment Standards.

# Vacation

We believe employees should take responsibility for managing their own time off.  You are entitled to 4 weeks paid vacation per year.Employees are encouraged to take vacation time as needed, provided that they use good judgment to ensure that business needs are met.

In accordance with the Act Respecting Labour Standards (Quebec), employees must utilize  vacation entitlements as outlined below.

Entitlement to a vacation is acquired during a period of 12 consecutive months, at a rate of 8% of salary, equivalent to 20 days of vacation in a year. This amount may be prorated for employees working reduced hours.

The annual vacation period runs from  April 1 to March 31, unless otherwise stated on an employee's contract.

Vacation must be used within 12 months of the year it is earned.

Vacation will be tracked and used as the basis for calculating vacation that may be payable upon termination of employment. Employees will not earn vacation pay towards this entitlement while on any type of unpaid leave. The Company will monitor the entitlement per year for all employees. 

If it is determined that an employee is not taking this time, the Company may schedule time off for you on your behalf for any reason in accordance with Provincial Employment Standards.

### Scheduling vacation

All vacation time must be pre-approved by your manager. Vacation time is approved on a first come, first served basis. 

**NOTE:** **Any vacation request that is for 3 weeks or more, must be approved and confirmed by one of the executive team. Submit your request via Bamboo and your manager will then seek approval from either Floh, Michelle or Lisa. Managers should make the request in writing through either Slack or email and once approved, a copy of it should be sent to HR (Shelley).**

**Vacation time is any time off**, whether a half day or full day (excluding sick days and in particular sudden sick days that could not be pre-approved). 

All time off requests go through **[Bamboo HR](https://alleycorpnord.bamboohr.com/login.php)** (on your home page, click on Request Time Off). The request will go directly to your manager for approval.

Notice time for a vacation should be proportional to the length of the vacation desired. Employees must provide their Manager with one 
(1) months advance notice for one (1) week of continuous time off, two (2) months advance notice for two (2) weeks of continuous time off and three (3) months notification for three (3) or more weeks of continuous time off, to allow scheduling adjustments and to plan for business interruptions.

All employees are strongly encouraged to use their minimum entitlements prior to the end of the vacation period. In the event that an employee is unable to take this time during the calendar year in which it was earned, one (1) week may be carried over into the next year to be used within the first quarter.

# Sick days

The Company recognizes that the inability to work because of illness or injury may cause economic hardship.  As such, employees are entitled to 5 paid sick days per year, pro-rated based on date of hire.

An employee can also use earned sick time if required to miss work in order to:

1. to care for a physical or mental illness, injury or medical condition affecting the employee or the employee’s child, spouse, parent, or parent of a spouse; or
2. to attend routine medical appointments of the employee or the employee’s child, spouse, parent, or parent of a spouse.

The Company reserves the right to require Physician Certification(s) of the need for sick time if an employee uses sick time for more than 3 consecutive days.

Employees must make a good faith effort to notify an employer in advance if the need for earned sick time is foreseeable (for example, for routine medical appointments). For unforeseen absences, employees are expected to notify their supervisor as soon as reasonably possible.

The Company encourages employees to use sick time when necessary to maintain their health and prevent the spread of illness. If an employee does not use sick time, it will not be a paid out or carried over to the following calendar year.

For periods of extended illness or injury, employees may be eligible for Short-Term Disability through Canada Life.  For more information regarding this plan, please contact your PEO Canada Benefits Contact at 1-877-271-7720.

Unexcused absenteeism is grounds for disciplinary action, up to and including termination. If you are absent for three (3) or more consecutive days without notification or approval, you will be considered to have voluntarily abandoned your employment with the Company.  The effective date of termination will be the last day the employee reported for work.

# Bereavement Leave

**Quebec:** 

If you are visiting this page after a relative’s death, we understand that this is a difficult time for you.

Employee’s may be absent from work in the event of a relative’s death. While they are absent, their employment relationship is protected.

## **Death or funeral of a relative**

A worker is entitled to 5 days off, including 2 with pay, for the death or funeral of:

- their spouse
- their child
- their spouse’s child
- their mother or father
- their brother or sister

They may also be absent from work for 1 day without pay for the death or funeral of:

- their son-in-law or daughter-in-law
- one of their grandparents
- one of their grandchildren
- one of their parents-in-law (their spouse’s mother or father)
- their brother-in-law or sister-in-law (their spouse’s brother or sister)

The days off must be taken between the death and the funeral. This means that some days could be taken at the time of death and, after the worker has returned to work, other days could be taken for the funeral.

## **Death of a minor child**

A worker may be absent from work without pay for up to 104 weeks following the death of their minor child.

## **End of paternity, parental or adoption benefits upon the death of a child**

# Paid holidays

Statutory holidays falling on a Saturday, will generally be observed on the Friday before the Statutory Holiday.  If a Statutory Holiday falls on a Sunday, this Holiday will generally be observed on the following Monday.
