# Levelling & Promotions

All individuals are expected to progress until L4 (at least). Until L4, individuals will be promoted when they have been *consistently* attaining most skills required for a target level for more than 6 months. Promotions from one level to the next are expected to take 2 years at a minimum, and more after L4.

At L4 and up, promotions usually involve a conversation with your manager, as well as a mandate and a specific need for a manager or staff developer in a team. 

It is worth noting that not everyone will progress in each column in lockstep. For example, if you perform at L4 in the Execution area and others but at L2 in Architecture, you will not be stuck as a L2 but you will likely not be promoted all the way to L4 without improvement in other areas.

### When and how does levelling happen?

- Hiring & onboarding: New hires will be levelled and levels will be validated at the 90 day mark.
- Review cycles: Bi-annual reviews are a great time for managers to go over career objectives with their reports. At this point, promotions to the next level can be discussed.
- When starting a new role: If you are joining a new company or otherwise changing roles, this may be a good time to discuss a level change. This is particularly the case for L4 and above.

*Remember: All level decisions are subject to calibration from your HR team*

# Using the Career Ladder for levelling

The [skills & competencies matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ssMa8McQ37GDlHnCXmCJTo7w-Hf6CoiegzR3nrgVyNw/edit#gid=1329489468) is a tool to be used for you and your manager to assess your performance and create career goals for you. It is not perfect or absolutely comprehensive.

Here are some tips on how to use/read it:

- The ladder level is not an objective criterion or formula. The ladder level descriptions provide some example behaviours and capabilities, but aren't exhaustive and need to be written in a general way to account for the various roles we have in the organization
- The matrix describes the distinguishing factors from one level to the next, along with some specific qualities and traits that we look for.
- Levels are cumulative — ie. a L4 is expected to do everything a L3 does, plus the additional expectations.
- The ladder level should not be used to elevate the opinion of an individual's personality. A 360 review with manager, peers and self-evaluation will be handled separately and will address additional concerns that fall outside of levels, such as values. In other words, levels and performance are not 1:1.
- Advancing from one role to another requires a demonstration of track record – ie. having met or exceeded expectations for a *sustained* period of time on concrete initiatives. Especially at the higher levels of the ladder, the types of high-impact work we expect from you is very rarely fast, even at an early-stage, fast-moving company.
