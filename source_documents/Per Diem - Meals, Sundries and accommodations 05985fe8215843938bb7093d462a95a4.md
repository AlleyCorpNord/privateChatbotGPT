# Per Diem - Meals, Sundries and accommodations

For meal costs which are directly covered by a third party (e.g. supervisor, business associate, conference, hotel room breakfasts, airline), **please do not claim the full per diem.** You should only claim for the meals where you paid for the meal. 

**Per Diem Rate** (within Canada)

The rate is currently $60.00 per day. 

In addition, there is also an incidental allowance per day of $10.00 which no receipts are required for and can be used to cover such things as coffee, snacks, gratuities, dry cleaning, etc.

The suggested breakdown for meals is $12.00 for breakfast, $18.00  for lunch and $30.00 for dinner. 

Receipts for meals are not required.  We do ask that you keep all receipts for a period of 60 days in case of need of verification or validation by a client. 

When submitting expenses for meals or travel where you picked up the tab for more than just you, include all the names of all the people who participated. This can be added to Expensify.

**NOTE:** DETAILED receipts are required when submitting expenses, not just an email or credit card statement.

**Accommodation**

When staying with a relative, or other non-commercial lodging, the reimbursement rate will be $40.00 per night (Canadian dollars within Canada, and US dollars outside of Canada). No receipts are required.

Hotel accommodation requires an original hotel folio as the receipt. The room rate, tax, etc. must be shown in detail. A credit card receipt is not considered adequate. Individuals will normally only be reimbursed for single rate room charge, tax and parking. All other charges are normally not covered. The traveller is advised to review the room invoice carefully for accuracy upon checking out.

**NOTE:** DETAILED receipts are required when submitting expenses, not just an email or credit card statement.
