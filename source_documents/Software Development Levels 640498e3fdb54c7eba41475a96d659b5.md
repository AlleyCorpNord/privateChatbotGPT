# Software Development Levels

This document outlines the high level expectations of different levels of individual contributor software developers at AlleyCorp Nord. 

This document is accompanied by a [skills matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ssMa8McQ37GDlHnCXmCJTo7w-Hf6CoiegzR3nrgVyNw/edit#gid=1540870231). The matrix explains in more detail what attributes, skills, and behaviours contribute to a developer meeting the expectations of a level. 

The expectations below are meant to be read cumulatively – ie. a Senior Software Developer is expected to do everything a Software Developer III does, plus the additional expectations.

Execution and proficiency are the primary drivers of promotions at lower levels. At higher levels (for ICs as well as managers), the importance shifts to prioritization & scoping, as well as strategy and communication.

# Job levels & expectations

While the ladder and competency matrix bring an approach of valuing impact and maturity over years of experience, we include some approximations on years of experience to point out that the progression from one level to another takes many years. 

**A further note on promotions:**

All individuals are expected to progress until L4 (at least). Until L4, individuals will be promoted when they have been *consistently* attaining most skills required for a target level for more than 6 months. Promotions from one level to the next are expected to take 2 years at a minimum, and more after L4.
