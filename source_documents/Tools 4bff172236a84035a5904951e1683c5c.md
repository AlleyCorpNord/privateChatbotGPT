# Tools

- Notion: You are here! We use this for as much documentation as possible. It's the central knowledge hub for all AlleyCorp Nord concerns, and for development work on products we develop 100% in house.
- BambooHR: Used for tracking vacation, assets, etc.
- Slack:
    - Where most of the action takes place!
    - Peruse the list of channels, and feel free to create new ones for specific topics.
    - Please keep #general to professional matters!
- G-Suite:
    - Calendar, gmail, Hangouts, Drive are all heavily used.
    - Groups are used to reach the team — team@alleycorpnord.com goes to all
- 1password:
    - Please use secure passwords. We strongly recommend using 1password's built in password generator and TOTP for multi-factor authentication.
    - Create shared vaults per project as needed to share credentials with team members.
    - Pro tip: If your incubation also has 1password, or you have a personal one, you can [make life easier by using the same master password for all accounts](https://support.1password.com/multiple-accounts/).
    - Fun fact! 1password will give you a [family account for free](https://support.1password.com/link-family/) as a member of a business team.
- [15five](https://www.15five.com):
    - Used for weekly feedback. In some cases (Capable Health) you will use the incubation's 15five account or equivalent.
- Expensify
    - Used for submitting expenses. [You can sign up here.](https://join.my.expensify.com/?team=E6F3F569BA98A788)
    - **NOTE:** when signing up be sure to put in your full name so that the expense can be identified with the right person.
