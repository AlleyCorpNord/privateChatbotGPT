# Accommodations

Travelling to clients

When travelling on ACN business the client will usually pick up the cost of the hotel. 

- If that is the case the client should book the hotel room for you. You may be required to provide a credit card at the front desk upon arrival. When checking out please get a written receipt for payment by the client and keep in your files.
- If that is not the case the client still needs to pre-approve the rate for the accommodations.  We will take care of this when getting overall approval of the trip budget.

If the client is not assuming the costs of accommodations:

- Find the most reasonable rate, closest to your destination.  In most cases it is better to make sure you have flexibility to cancel the room should something unexpected come up.
- Upgraded rooms will not be approved.

**NOTE:** DETAILED receipts are required when submitting expenses, not just an email or credit card statement.
