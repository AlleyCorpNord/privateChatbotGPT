- Joint Expenses - Combining ACN Travel with Personal Travel:
    
    Before travellers take indirect routes to their destination (interrupting business portions of a trip for personal travel or vice versa), the VP Operations and the traveller must agree on a fair allocation of expenses for the trip.  In any event, ACN’s portion is limited to expenses for travel, accommodation, food, and other expenses that would have been charged had the interruption not occurred.
