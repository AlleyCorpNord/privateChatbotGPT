# Career Ladders

Within these pages, you will find a career ladder for software development careers. It is by no means 100% comprehensive. At the moment, it is accompanied by a [competency and skills matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ssMa8McQ37GDlHnCXmCJTo7w-Hf6CoiegzR3nrgVyNw/edit?usp=sharing), which is used as a reference for determining individuals’ levels in the ladder, and additional tools and documents will be added over time.

These materials are a point of reference and far from final — they are living documents that will grow and evolve with the company. They are also ****************************************************************************unique and specific to the ACN context**************************************************************************** in meaningful ways, and by no means meant to be universal.

The goal of our career ladder is twofold:

1. Creating **consistent expectations** — Levels provide a benchmark against which someone can be assessed; they ensure performance management is structured, documented, and intelligible. As an example, if you move teams, you can expect that your skills can be adequately explained from one manager to the next without a need for complicated translation and self-advocacy. 
2. Providing a blueprint of **career opportunities** and the skills that are important for an individual to attain and demonstrate if they wish to advance.

### How do I read these documents?

Start by understanding your level and its expectations. Unless you are a manager, reading about levels is not super useful in the abstract. Once you understand where you are in this ladder, you can read about your level, starting in this knowledge base, and expand by reading about the skills you are expected to have.

# Software development career path(s)

The AlleyCorp Nord career ladder for software developers is roughly as follows.

![ladder.png](ladder.png)

L4 (Senior) is considered a terminal or final state — most developers will be senior developers forever. Being a senior developer forever does ***not*** mean an individual’s compensation or opportunities will be curtailed.

[Software Development Levels](Software%20Development%20Levels%20640498e3fdb54c7eba41475a96d659b5.md)

### Higher levels

We have expanded on more senior levels past the ones where most of our employees stand because we want to make it clear that there are paths for success and continued growth *both* as an individual contributor or as a manager. 

Progressing to an L5, whether on a management or individual contributor track, requires both **deliberate choice on behalf of the individual, as well as a mandate and opportunity.** On both tracks, available positions become rarer the higher up you go. 

More information on the IC and management tracks past L4 can be found below:

[Software Development – Higher IC Levels](Software%20Development%20%E2%80%93%20Higher%20IC%20Levels%2050b2276256764e04a0316957d002fa6e.md)

[Manager Levels](Manager%20Levels%2012fdeda18daa4aca87ae559d7db979a7.md)

(Wait, what about tech leads? A [tech lead is a role](The%20Technical%20Lead%201a0d7a3555bc41b8a143434327214bb4.md), not a level.)

## The pendulum & reversing the dichotomy

AlleyCorp Nord believes strongly in a "pendulum" approach to engineering progressions. Not everyone who takes a management role needs to *stay* in a management role forever, and someone who becomes a staff or principal IC may choose to take a management role once or twice. However, staff+ IC competencies are very different from management competencies, and it follows that excelling at one does not imply excelling in the other. In short, moving back and forth is possible and encouraged, but far from easy!

Since most teams at ACN are essentially creating a company/product from zero, a manager may join a team as the first and only team member. As such, it's important that managers (regardless of their seniority) stay close to the technical work – "hands-on", as it were.

Likewise, senior ICs may also find themselves being the first developer at a company without a dedicated manager. Therefore, we believe that all senior developers should take on coordination and alignment roles at some moment in time, even if briefly. For more on this, see the [Technical Lead](The%20Technical%20Lead%201a0d7a3555bc41b8a143434327214bb4.md) page.

# Other paths

This document is software development-centric because only software developers have enough critical mass at the moment  in the organization to provide sufficient data points for levels to make sense. 

Other career ladders are in progress, and more granularity will be added to the management track as the organization grows.
