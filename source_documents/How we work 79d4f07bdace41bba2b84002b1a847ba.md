# How we work

This page elaborates some norms around time management and complements our HR policies. 

# Holidays

All AlleyCorp Nord employees observe Canadian statutory holidays. 

Since most of our team is in Quebec, Quebec holidays will likely be the most noticed. However, if you are not in Quebec, you still have the right to take your local stat days! [See the Time Off Policy](https://www.notion.so/Time-Off-Policy-b0eb6f1d5f3b4b5bae17e8525b690b25?pvs=21) for details.

# Tracking Time Off

Please make sure you read and follow our HR policies, in addition to this document, especially for info relating to timelines required for approvals.

BambooHR is the tool we use for tracking all employee information.  

Please make sure to request and log any time off in [**BambooHR**](https://app.bamboohr.com/login/).

When you add  information to your profile, **please add a photo and include any food allergies** you might have.

[**https://alleycorpnord.bamboohr.com/home**](https://alleycorpnord.bamboohr.com/home/)

Your manager will approve any time off within a few business days.  If you need a quicker approval please connect with your manager, Adriana Arian (Manager, People & Culture), Shelley Vassall (HR Coordinator) or Michelle King (VP Ops).

# Working Status

Since we work remotely, it is crucial that your team members know when you are and aren't available. A good way to do this is the Slack integration with Google Calendar, which will automatically change your status when you're marked out of office or in a meeting.  When you're on vacation, the Slack extension will reflect that you're out of office as well. 

You can also use custom but expressive Slack statuses to express when you're not at your keyboard ‚Äì e.g. "üö∂üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èerrands, back at 3pm". 

# Troubleshooting Calendar Issues

Some of our team members suffer from one or both of the following afflictions:

- Focus time is hard because they get invited to meetings at random times (*)
- They have multiple G-Suite accounts with multiple calendars to keep in sync

[Reclaim.ai](http://reclaim.ai) has been helpful for some of us to address both of these issues. It does 2-way sync between as many calendars as you want, and it allows you to dynamically schedule time on your calendar for tasks and habits. We have a team plan, which you can join if you need the paid features. Note you *must* use your [alleycorpnord.com](http://alleycorpnord.com) email as your primary email to automatically join our plan and get paid features.

(*) On this topic in particular, we encourage all subteams within ACN to work to establish regular cadences and blocks of meeting time.
