# Manager Levels

This document outlines the high level expectations of different levels of manager at AlleyCorp Nord. 

It is meant to be read ******before****** jumping into the [skills matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ssMa8McQ37GDlHnCXmCJTo7w-Hf6CoiegzR3nrgVyNw/edit#gid=1540870231). The matrix explains in more detail what attributes, skills, and behaviours contribute to a manager meeting the expectations of a level. 

The management track is inherently interdisciplinary. In a manager role at ACN, you are expected to be hands-on, since your team will be small. However, you are primarily concerned with people and deliverables. 

Not all managers are software developers. While we do not currently have career ladders for any discipline other than development, it is expected that managers will manage teams that come from different disciplines, and developers will be managed by non-developers sometimes.

Managers will have job descriptions that align with their discipline of origin, but expectations relative to seniority along the management axis of their jobs stays the same. 

# Job levels & expectations
