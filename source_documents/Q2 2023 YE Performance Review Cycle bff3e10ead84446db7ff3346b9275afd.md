# Q2 2023 YE Performance Review Cycle

Growth is cherished at ACN. We want to make sure our people have a clear sense of where they stand. This will be made possible with the collaboration of managers, peers and employees themselves.

# High-level objectives for *this* review cycle

- Continue with ACNâ€™s semi-annual review cycle
- A new step was added last year to level employees as per the career ladder.  We started with Developers and Managers. For 2023, anyone that was not leveled (i.e. Designers) will be done prior to the semi-annual review.
- Your salary may be adjusted if you and when you enter a new level
- Provide people with actionable feedback and concrete objectives for the next 6-12 months. Ensuring that you know where you are and knowing what it takes to get to the level you aspire to be

**See below for all details on Career Ladders:**

## Why now?

- As we grow, it is necessary to standardize more processes.
- With people moving between teams, it is important to ensure fair treatment for everyone.

# Process

1. **Levelling Exercise:**
    
    We have created a consistent framework for expectations and performance. (*Including compensation.*) 
    We implemented this only for Devs, Designers and managers **************at the moment.************** 
    The Levelling Matrix is a living document. Once started, its purpose is to provide a clear definition of where a person stands in their position/career. This will be in a clear "rubric" format for Engineering Managers to use.
    
2. **360 Review:**
    
    *Reflection, honest feedback, career growth, goals. -* It is so important to have feedback from all angles! 
    
    - On 15Five
    - The employee will conduct a self-evaluation.
    - Managers and employees assign 1-3 peers, who will then evaluate the employee. Managers will ensure that no one has too many peer reviews to complete.
    - Managers will prepare employee evaluations.
    - Manager to meet with employee 1:1 to discuss feedback
    - If you have recently changed teams, the manager you spent most of the year with will be meeting with you.
    
3. **Setting Goals:**
    
    In talking with your manager, you will be setting goals for the new year.
    
    If you are changing teams, this process may be delayed until the start of work in a new team or project.
