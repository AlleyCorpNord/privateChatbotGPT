# Recording Conversations in the Workplace Policy

Have you ever found yourself in a position where you had a conversation (s) in a meeting that you did not take any notes about but you need to recall some important information at a later time and are unable to? As an alternative to taking notes, perhaps you wonder if you can record conversations like this in the future so you can easily refer back to them.

**Canadian Law**

Canadian law allows recording of conversations if you are a party to that conversation. This means it is not a “criminal offence” to record your own conversations at work even if the other people being recorded do not know they are being recorded. However, i**t is illegal to record a conversation you are not a party to.**

**For example,** it is not illegal to record your meeting with your supervisor, but it is illegal to plant a recording device in the meeting between your supervisor and someone else if you are not present at that particular conversation.

**ACN Policy**

**Out of courtesy and respect, at ACN, we require that if you choose to record a conversation in the workplace, you must disclose that you are in fact recording it and get consent from anyone that you plan to record.**

**Can I be fired if I record a conversation in the workplace?**

If you do not disclose that you are going to record a conversation or obtain the required consent from anyone that you plan to record, it could be grounds for dismissal.
