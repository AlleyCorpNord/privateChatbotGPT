# Medical Leave

**Medical Leave of Absence- Canada Life Short-Term Disability (STD):**

The Gold benefits plan includes coverage for short-term disability if an employee is requiring a medical leave that pertains to employee’s health. This would provide income replacement. The disability program provides employees with a weekly benefit payment equal to 66.7% of the first $600.00 dollars of weekly earnings and 50% of the remainder to a maximum benefit of $1,350.00 per week. Short-Term Disability benefits may be paid for a maximum of 17 weeks.

**Benefit Payment begins:**

- Immediately, with no waiting period for a disability resulting from bodily injury caused directly and independently of all other causes through accidental means;
- On the date the employee has day surgery, or on the first day of hospital confinement provided the employee is hospitalized for at least one night;
- Following a seven day waiting period for a disability resulting from an illness or disease.

**For your information the STD process will be as follows:**

1. Employee will complete an Employee statement and send it directly to Canada Life.
2. Employee will have their doctor complete an Attending Physician statement and send it directly to Canada Life.
3. An Employer Statement will need to be completed by AlleyCorp and I will then submit to Canada Life on your behalf. Once you have a confirmed medical leave start date, please let me know, so we can get the forms started right away and I will also reach out to the employee with all the STD information. Canada Life needs all 3 statement forms completed before the claims can be assessed by them.

Once Canada Life has received all of the relevant information, they will begin the assessment of the claim. It generally takes 10 business days to assess or longer if they find that additional information is required. Once a decision has been made by Canada Life, employee will receive a letter stating either when their STD benefits will commence or why the claim has not been approved at this time. PEO Canada will receive a copy of this letter as well.
