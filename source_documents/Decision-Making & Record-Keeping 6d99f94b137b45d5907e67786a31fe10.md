# Decision-Making & Record-Keeping

AlleyCorp Nord is somewhat unique, in that employees work on a number of different incubations. Since all projects are early-stage and require a lot of decisions to be made, it may be advantageous to solicit feedback from other AlleyCorp Nord team members, who may have expertise on some technology or design pattern being considered. 

All decisions on architectural choices for a project **are owned by the team that will be working on it** — suggestions from team members working on other projects are just suggestions and should be treated as such. 

**RFCs:** A great format for soliciting feedback on an architecture pattern is an RFC. Many incubations will keep their own records for RFCs — however, in order to solicit feedback from ACN team members you may wish to copy an RFC into the ACN [RFC log](https://www.notion.so/13976a005a864606a3f1cd0a863df1fc?pvs=21). 

**Stack choices & comparisons:** Team members may wish to share the results of some research into tools that may be applicable across multiple incubations. These can be shared in [Tech stack(s)](https://www.notion.so/Tech-stack-s-26951fd3bb56474293fdfa5d0419871f?pvs=21).
