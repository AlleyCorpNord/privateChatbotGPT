# Parental/Maternity/Paternity Leave (and Top Up) Policy

Kids are great ‚Äì enjoy your time with them! We encourage parents at AlleyCorp Nord to take time off to bond with their kids. 

AlleyCorp Nord will provide full-time employees with paid birth, recovery time, and child bonding time upon the birth, adoption, or foster placement of a child.

The policy below outlines the process for accessing parental leave as provided by provincial governments, as well as supplemental company-provided top up. 

<aside>
üìå For the avoidance of doubt, wherever there is reference to 100% of the employees wages the following limit applies: **If you earn more than an annual salary of $140,000 CAD, you will not be paid any more supplemental compensation the weekly base equivalent of a yearly salary of $140,000 CAD, less any Provincial and Federal tax withholdings required by law.**

</aside>

**A few definitions to get you started :** 

- We will refer to **parental leave** exclusively for simplicity, as this policy applies to parents of any type (gestating or not). Where possible, we will clarify terms within the scope in which they apply, since different entities use different terminology to mean different things (fun!).
- **Employee Eligibility:** Full-time employees (30+ hrs/week) with a tenure of more than 6 months at AlleyCorp Nord.
- **Child Eligibility:** Any and all children that is eligible for parental leave as per your province.
- **SUB:** Supplemental Unemployment Benefits program, colloquially usually known as ‚ÄúTop Up‚Äù

# **For the Province of Quebec:**

**Employee must give at least 3 weeks‚Äô notice before going on any type of parental leave.** 

*Please note that we use Quebec‚Äôs definition of ‚Äúmaternity‚Äù and ‚Äúpaternity‚Äù in this section only, for consistency relative to government documentation.* 

In Quebec, parents are entitled to:

**Maternity leave:** May begin as of the 16th week before the expected date of delivery and end no later than 20 weeks after the week of the delivery.

**Paternity leave:** ¬†If the leave begins at the time of delivery, the week of delivery is not included in the calculation. The leave may begin as of the week of the child's birth and end no later than 78 weeks after the child‚Äôs birth.

At the request of the employee, the paternity leave is suspended, divided or extended if their child's health conditions require it. In some situations, at the request of the employee and if the employer agrees, the leave may be split into weeks. Leave cannot be transferred to or shared with the mother.

**Parental leave:** In the case of a birth, parental leave may begin the week of the child's birth. It is in addition to the 18-week maternity leave or the 5-week paternity leave. The leave ends no later than 78 weeks after the child‚Äôs birth.

The period of time an employee is on leave will be treated as continuous service for purposes of seniority. It does not count as time worked for the purpose of accruing vacation time or pay.

*During maternity/paternity/parental leave, Quebec employees may be entitled to benefits under the QPIP program and federal Employment Insurance.*

# Parental Leave **Top Up (SUB) Policy - Canada**

AlleyCorp Nord will administer this Supplemental Unemployment Benefits (SUB) plan, in accordance with Canadian Revenue Agency guidelines, Service Canada Employment Insurance (EI) guidelines and also ensuring compliance with the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan (QPIP).

Employees who qualify for a parental leave benefit through EI or QPIP benefits will receive supplemental compensation in an amount such that the EI or QPIP sponsored paid leave benefit plus the supplemental compensation equal 100% of the employee‚Äôs gross weekly wage, up to a maximum of a $140,000 CAD annual salary. **If you earn more than an annual salary of $140,000 CAD, you will not be paid any more supplemental compensation of the weekly base equivalent of a yearly salary of $140,000 CAD, less any Provincial and Federal tax withholdings required by law.**

Eligible employees will receive a maximum of up to eight (8) weeks of SUB per birth, adoption, or placement of a child/children. 

Additional considerations and restrictions:

- Paid top-up parental leave under this policy must begin and be used within twelve (12) months of the birth, adoption, or placement of the eligible child. These leaves will run concurrently with any other provincially or federally protected leaves to which the eligible employee is entitled.
- If a multiple birth, adoption, or qualified placement occurs (e.g., the birth of twins or adoption or placement of siblings), the total amount of SUB granted for that certain event will not be increased.
- In no case will an employee receive more than eight (8) weeks of paid Top Up SUB payment in a rolling 12-month period.
- Each week of paid leave is compensated at 100% **(see limitation above)** the employees‚Äô regular base pay less the value of EI Payments and any Provincial and Federal Tax withholdings, required by law. This will be paid on the Company‚Äôs regularly scheduled pay dates.
    - Upon termination of the individual‚Äôs employment at AlleyCorp Nord, the employee will not be paid for any unused supplementary benefit under the Top-Up Policy.
    - The Top Up Benefit may be taken at any time during the 12 months immediately following the birth, adoption, or placement of a child with the employee. The Leave cannot be taken intermittently and is to be used with no break period(s).
- The Top Up Benefit may not be used or extended beyond this 12-month time frame; unused Top Up Benefit will be forfeited and not paid out. Upon termination of the individual‚Äôs employment at the company, they will not be paid out for any unused Top Up Benefit.

# **Procedure for Requesting Top Up Benefits**

All employees are requested to discuss their plans for parental leave as soon as possible with their manager, in order to discuss the work transition and tentative return to work plan.¬† 

It is *very* important that the employee coordinate closely with PEOCanada and the AlleyCorp Nord HR team to ensure all benefit eligibility is coordinated with the relevant entities. In other words ‚Äî this is a complicated bureaucracy, please make sure you understand everything and work with us to get all the right forms in the right places.

Some basics to get started with requesting leave and access to the Top Up benefit:

- Leave must be requested in advance as per relevant provincial guidelines (see above sections).
- Requests must be submitted to the employee‚Äôs direct manager and/or the Human Resources (@Shelley Vassall, @Michelle)
- Employees must complete the necessary forms and provide all documentation to substantiate the request as required by PEO Canada and the HR team.
- Employee must submit their written leave request and schedule in advance, where applicable and in line with provincial guidelines. Any changes to the schedule must be approved by HR and the employee‚Äôs direct manager.
- AlleyCorp Nord will notify PEO Canada of the impending leave. PEO Canada will coordinate the appropriate documents and estimated calculations for the Top-Up plan benefit.
- PEO Canada and/or AlleyCorp Nord may require a medical certificate or letter certifying pregnancy and giving the estimated date of delivery or other supporting documentation of the leave.

## Coordinating government benefits

PEO Canada will coordinate the appropriate documents and estimated calculations for Employment Insurance (EI) or QPIP and corresponding SUB payments.

As a general guide for how benefit delivery will work:

- PEO Canada will issue a Record of Employment (ROE) to the employee after their final regular pay has been issued. The ROE will be needed to apply for (any type of) parental benefits through Employment Insurance.
- EI or QPIP (depending on the province) will notify the employee of approval with an EI or QPIP (depending on the province)  Statement. A copy of this statement must be provided to PEO Canada as soon as possible, since PEO Canada will not be able to administer the SUP benefit until after the EI or QPIP (depending on the province)  is received.
- Eligibility for the Top Up SUB is determined by EI or QPIP (depending on the province)  ‚Äì that is to say, the SUB start date is determined by EI or QPIP
    - If the employee must satisfy a one (1) week waiting period for their QPIP benefit, AlleyCorp Nord will begin to supplement their weekly income at 100% **(see limitation above)** for that one (1) week waiting period and count it toward the 8 week maximum. (Should this apply in your case AlleyCorp Nord will top up this first week so your salary will be covered up to the equivalent, maximum of a weeks pay with 140,000CAD salary)
    - For the remaining eligible QPIP SUB plan period, AlleyCorp Nord will supplement the QPIP benefit payment to 100% **(see limitation above)** of the employee‚Äôs weekly earnings.
- The EI / QPIP SUB will be calculated based on regular weekly earnings less the EI / QPIP benefit payment.
- The EI / QPIP SUB will be paid on the regular pay schedule throughout the leave, for a maximum period of eight (8) weeks.
