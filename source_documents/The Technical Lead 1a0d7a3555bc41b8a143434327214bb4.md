# The Technical Lead

The tech/team lead (also sometimes known at tech lead) is not necessarily a position on the engineering seniority ladder, but rather a set of responsibilities that may be taken by any engineer of the senior level and up, potentially as a stepping stone to any level above. 

Tech leads have a scope, which may be, for example a specific project or initiative, a cross-functional ("scrum") team, or a specific discipline within a team (front-end developers). 

# Impact

A tech lead is focused on and responsible for a team's work product.

# Responsibilities

The tech lead contributes to engineering deliverables for a team, while also being responsible for a team's ability to ship product in increments. 

The tech lead is accountable for sprint (or equivalent) **planning and delivery**, which includes:

- Preparing sprints (or other development iterations) — ensuring the team has enough context and detail to commit to deliverables, prioritizing, highlighting time or resource constraints
- Communicating commitments and risks clearly to the team and stakeholders
- Proactively identifying blockers for the team and helping them to address or mitigate them
- Continuously updating the team on evolving priorities as needed
- Ensuring the timely and thorough review of code and other deliverables (e.g. RFCs, spikes, documentation)

Additionally, the tech lead supports their direct supervisor (EM or higher) with **architecture and technology strategy** decisions, including but not limited to:

- Continuously challenging team members on their architectural decisions (viability, stability, relevance to the business, etc)
- Helping team members articulate and explain technical decisions to stakeholders
- Identifying tooling and process needs for improving the team's ability to deliver

The tech lead may assist their direct supervisor with **teambuilding and hiring** (if relevant to their context):

- Contributing to hiring plans and interview processes
- Providing recommendations on mentorship and professional development opportunities for team members

Further, the tech lead assists the product manager by:

- Representing the engineering team's needs
- Workshopping requirements for deliverables and ensuring they are comprehensible to the team
- Contributing to roadmaps and quarterly planning, with a focus on the viability of deliverables relative to the team's capacity
