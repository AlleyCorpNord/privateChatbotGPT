This plan provides coverage for out of country emergency care. The coverage is provided for the plan member and his eligible dependents  in the event of a medical emergency which occurs while temporarily travelling outside Canada for business, education or vacation purposes.

Benefits are reimbursed at a rate of 100% of eligible medical expenses, such as ground ambulance fees, physicians’ fees, lab fees and hospital fees that are incurred in the treatment of the initial medical emergency. Hospital room charges are limited to a semi-private room.

The plan provides coverage for the initial medical emergency only.

As coverage is provided only for certain medical expenses incurred as a result of a medical emergency, this means that costs incurred for elective medical services, scheduled treatment and surgeries, regular, ongoing or follow-up medical care are not covered.

A medical emergency is:

- A sudden and unexpected injury;
- The onset of a condition not previously known or identified prior to departure from Canada; or
- An unexpected episode of a condition known or identified prior to departure from Canada.

An unexpected episode means it would not have been reasonable to expect the episode to occur while travelling outside Canada. If a person was suffering from symptoms before departure from Canada, Canada Life may request medical documentation to determine whether, in the circumstances, it could have reasonably been anticipated that the person may require medical treatment while outside Canada.

For verification of medical coverage in the event that medical treatment is required, the patient/insured should contact UnitedHealthcare Global Assistance at the 24-hour emergency telephone numbers provided on their Global Medical Assistance card.

For verification of medical coverage in the event that medical treatment is required, the patient/insured should contact UnitedHealthcare Global Assistance at the 24-hour emergency telephone numbers provided on their Global Medical Assistance card.

The patient is required to maintain coverage with their provincial health plan in order to be eligible for benefits under the Canada Life group plan. If they are planning to be away from Canada for an extended period greater than six months, we suggest they contact their provincial health plan to determine whether extended coverage is available.

**1 - Does my OOC coverage cover me if I travel and become infected with the novel coronavirus?** 

Members affected by the novel coronavirus can continue to expect their claims to be handled on a case-by-case basis based on plan coverage. Your claim won’t be denied just because it’s related to novel coronavirus – it’ll be treated like any other claim.

**2 - I am travelling OOC.  Will there be any change to my OOC coverage due to the outbreak of the coronavirus?**  

Claims related to the novel coronavirus that occurred during travel to a country with travel advisory warnings will be treated and assessed like any other claim under your plan. Plan coverages vary, and so that’s why every claim will be handled on a case-by-case basis.

**3- Am I covered for expenses incurred due to being self-quarantined or mass quarantined?**  

Your out of country coverage has always been designed to cover eligible expenses when you have symptoms from a medical emergency that require you to seek treatment. Expenses incurred when not experiencing symptoms, whether under quarantine or not, are not covered under Canada Life policies.

**4- Will there be changes to my coverage if I travel to a region with a travel advisory?**

Travel to regions with travel advisories or travel bans, including those due to illnesses such as COVID-19, do not exclude a claimant from coverage under standard Canada Life group benefits plans. Our usual plan parameters and provisions apply, and we will not exclude coverage for someone solely and exclusively based on the fact they they’ve travelled to a region with a travel advisory or ban.

Please note: The Government of Canada advises avoiding all non-essential travel, citing fast moving border restrictions and quarantines.

**5- Does my OOC coverage cover me if I travel and become infected with COVID-19?**

If you’re OOC and are experiencing a medical emergency such as having contracted COVID19, your usual OOC and Travel Assistance coverage will apply. We will cover medical treatments related to the initial medical emergency in accordance with plan provisions as well as follow up treatment if you’re unable to get home prior to the end of the trip. Your claim won’t be denied just because it’s related to COVID-19 – it’ll be treated like any other claim. However, plans vary, so that’s why we’re assessing claims individually. Benefits are limited to persons who experience a medical emergency, it’s important to know that expenses incurred when not experiencing symptoms, whether under quarantine or not, are not covered.

**6- What happens if I’ve contracted COVID-19 while OOC and wish to be evacuated?**

Due to the protective requirements around COVID-19 while transporting a patient, all evacuations for patients with COVID-19 are being handled by health officials.

**7- What happens if the country I’m in issues an evacuation notice?**

When a city is in lockdown, or has high-level travel advisories, we may not be able to give assistance because officials may refuse our entry. When a country issues evacuation notices, members are encouraged to follow the protocols issued by the country’s authorities, which includes the process for obtaining assistance. Typically, assistance is left with the Canadian Embassy.

**8- Will costs (flights, lodging, etc.) associated with returning home at a later date be covered?**

If the member is directed to quarantine by a physician or public health official while OOC and they’re experiencing a medical emergency (have contracted COVID-19), applicable Travel Assistance (GMA) coverage will apply, which includes transportation reimbursement if prepaid return transport is missed because the patient is hospitalized or quarantined. Lodging benefits subject to limitations and maximums would also be covered. Generally, meal expenses are not covered. Expenses which were refunded or could be refunded (e.g., entitled to a refund elsewhere) would not be covered.

Michelle's note : please pay attention to the wording above. It frequently points to "medical emergency". If you are sick and confined but not experiencing a medical emergency it is most likely there will be no coverage i.e. for hotels etc.  The FIRST step if you ever get sick while travelling is to contact the insurance company to see if/what will be covered.
