# →Budget Approval ←

All travel expenses must be approved in advance. We suggest that a simple schedule with airfare, accommodations and meals be prepared and approved, with written confirmation, by the person paying the expenses. The payer will often be a combination of the customer and ACN. Therefore, be sure to allow sufficient time to prepare your budget and obtain approval.

Below is an example of a chart to build, preferably in Sheets so it can be easily shared and commented on.

If there is a team trip (i.e., more than one person on a team), the **team leader** must prepare a budget for the entire trip and submit it to @Michelle.

Below is a sample table to build, preferably in Sheets format, so we can easily share and comment.

**Note**: When arriving or leaving New York City, please opt to use a taxi service rather than Ubers to and from the airport.

**********Note:********** If taking a taxi or Uber to your local airport is cheaper than using your personal vehicle and parking at the airport, you have to opt for the cheaper option
